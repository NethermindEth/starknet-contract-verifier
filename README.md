- [x] Cairo & Scarb 2.6.3
- [x] Cairo 2.6.3 & Scarb 2.6.4
- [x] Cairo 2.6.4 & Scarb 2.6.5

The source code release for each version is available at their respective branch at `release/2.<major_version>.<minor_version>`. For example, the release for `2.4.3` would live at `release/2.4.3`.


## Getting started

### Prerequisite

#### Installing Scarb

This CLI relies upon Scarb for dependencies resolving during compilation and thus require you to have Scarb installed for it to work properly. You can install Scarb following the instruction on their documentation at https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb.

Note that CLI version that you install should follow the version of the Scarb you have installed for it to work as expected.

<!-- #### Getting an api key

The verification CLI uses the public API of the block explorer under the hood, as such you will have to obtain your API key in order to start using the verifier.

You can get an API key from Voyager here with this form [https://forms.gle/34RE6d4aiiv16HoW6](https://forms.gle/34RE6d4aiiv16HoW6).

You can then set the api key via setting the environment variables.

```
API_KEY=<Your api key>
```

If you want to set the api key manually on each verifier call, you can also attach the variables like so:

```
API_KEY=<Your api key> starknet-contract-verifier
``` -->

#### Adding configuration for the verification

In order to start verification, you'll need to add a table in your `Scarb.toml` as such:

```toml
[package]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
starknet = ">=2.4.0"

[[target.starknet-contract]]
sierra = true

# Add the following section
[tool.voyager]
my_contract = { path = "main.cairo" }
```

The path should be set to the path of whichever contract you would like to verify, relative to your `src` directory. For the example above, the cairo contract is located at `src/main.cairo` and as such the path should be set to `main.cairo`.

Note that only one contract should be provided in this section as multi contract verification is not supported yet.

### Verification

First do a clone of this repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NethermindEth/starknet-contract-verifier.git
```

After cloning the repository, checkout to the release branch corresponding to the cairo version that your contract uses. For example, if you write your contract in `cairo 2.5.4`, you would do the following:

```bash
cd starknet-contract-verifier
git checkout release/2.5.4
```

To start the verifier, you can do the following command, and a prompt should guide you through the verification process.

```bash
cargo run --bin starknet-contract-verifier
```

If you are using `asdf` for the management of scarb binary on a project basis, you should make sure that the verifier runs in the directory of the project so that the verifier will detect and use the correct `scarb` binary for that project.

You can build the binaries and add it to path to make it easier to use the verifier.

```bash
# build all binaries
cargo build --all --release

# then add build target directory to path 
# depending on your shell this might be different.
# Add the following to the end of your shell configuration file
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/starknet-contract-verifier/target/release"

# you should now be able to call the verifier directly if build succeeds.
starknet-contract-verifier
```

You should be greeted with prompts that asks for the details of your cairo project & contracts, and will be guided step by step through the verification process.

## Building from source

If you are developing and building the project from source, you will first need to install rust.

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s
```

> Note: Builds for 2.4.3 and below only works with < Rust 1.77. As such please make sure that you have the correct rust version before building.

To build the project, simply do

```bash
cargo build
```

and the project should start building.

## Limitations and Known Issues

There's a few known issue with the current implementation of this verifier.


### 1. Limitation with `super` imports

If you use `super` import in your source code, the verifier would fail to resolve it and cause an `IMPORT ERROR`. This is an expected issue and we are in the process of fixing it.

### 2. Rearranging and restructure of the resulting verified files

It's possible that your modules get re-arranged after verification as the verifier tries to resolve your dependencies from the main contract and re-generate them into a new project. This is known and we are working towards making the generated project look as closely as possible with the original module structure.


### 3. Scarb.toml specified starknet versioning affects which binaries work with the verifier

The verifier would usually work cairo compiler versions that are lower than its version given no breaking changes between compiler versions, meaning using a `2.4.3` verifier with a compiler version of less than 2.4.3 would work as long as you specify in your `Scarb.toml` file the starknet version with a range including the verifier version (for example, `>=2.4.0` & `2.2.0` usually works for verifier `2.4.3`) If you use strict versioning for your starknet version in form of `=2.4.3` for example, it would stop working with verifier of other versions.
